# Contributing to Mainsail

If you are reading this document right now, you are probably considering to contribute to Mainsail and make it better than it is today. Thank you for taking that initiative!
Before submitting your contribution, please take a moment and make sure to read through our contribution guidelines:

- [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/meteyou/mainsail/.github/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)
- [Question or Problem?](#question)
- [Issue Reporting Guidelines](#issue-reporting-guidelines)
- [Pull Request Guidelines](#pull-request-guidelines)

## <a name="question"></a> Got a Question or Problem?

Please do not open issues for general support questions. We want to keep GitHub issues for bug reports and feature requests.
Instead, please visit us on [Discord](https://discord.gg/mainsail) to ask support-related questions.

Our Discord server is a much better place to ask general support questions. We take the right to close issues that are requests for general support and redirect people to Discord.

## <a name="issue"></a> Found a Bug?

If you find a bug in the source code, or you think that Mainsail is behaving odd in specific situations, you can help us to fix that issues by [submitting an issue](https://github.com/meteyou/mainsail/issues).
In case you fixed that issue already by yourself, you can [submit a Pull Request](#submit-pr) with that fix.

## Pull Request Guidelines

- The `master` branch is just a snapshot of the latest stable release. All development should be done in dedicated branches. **Do not submit PRs against the `master` branch.**

- Checkout a topic branch from the relevant branch, e.g. `develop`, and merge back against that branch.

- It's OK to have multiple small commits as you work on the PR - GitHub will automatically squash it before merging.

- If adding a new feature:

  - Provide a convincing reason to add this feature. Ideally, you should open a suggestion issue first and have it approved before working on it.

- If fixing bug:
  - If you are resolving a special issue, add `(fix #xxxx[,#xxxx])` (#xxxx is the issue id) in your PR title for a better release log, e.g. `update entities encoding/decoding (fix #3899)`.
  - Provide a detailed description of the bug in the PR. Live demo preferred.
  - Add appropriate test coverage if applicable.

## Committing Changes

Commit messages should follow the [commit message convention](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) so that changelogs can be automatically generated.
