# Mainsail Contributing Guide

Hi! I'm really excited that you are interested in contributing to Mainsail. Before submitting your contribution, please make sure to take a moment and read through the following guidelines:

- [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/meteyou/mainsail/.github/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)
- [Issue Reporting Guidelines](#issue-reporting-guidelines)
- [Pull Request Guidelines](#pull-request-guidelines)

## Issue Reporting Guidelines

- Use [https://github.com/meteyou/mainsail/issues](https://github.com/meteyou/mainsail/issues) to create new issues.

## Pull Request Guidelines

- The `master` branch is just a snapshot of the latest stable release. All development should be done in dedicated branches. **Do not submit PRs against the `master` branch.**

- Checkout a topic branch from the relevant branch, e.g. `develop`, and merge back against that branch.

- It's OK to have multiple small commits as you work on the PR - GitHub will automatically squash it before merging.

- If adding a new feature:

  - Provide a convincing reason to add this feature. Ideally, you should open a suggestion issue first and have it approved before working on it.

- If fixing bug:
  - If you are resolving a special issue, add `(fix #xxxx[,#xxxx])` (#xxxx is the issue id) in your PR title for a better release log, e.g. `update entities encoding/decoding (fix #3899)`.
  - Provide a detailed description of the bug in the PR. Live demo preferred.
  - Add appropriate test coverage if applicable.

## Committing Changes

Commit messages should follow the [commit message convention](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) so that changelogs can be automatically generated.

## Financial Contribution

As a pure community-driven project without major corporate backing, we also welcome financial contributions via Patreon and OpenCollective.
