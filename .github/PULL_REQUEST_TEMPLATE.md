<!--
  For Work In Progress Pull Requests, please use the Draft PR feature,
  see https://github.blog/2019-02-14-introducing-draft-pull-requests/ for further details.

  For a timely review/response, please avoid force-pushing additional
  commits if your PR already received reviews or comments.

  We use squash-merge to merge PRs, so the commit history is clean, but we use the PR title as the commit message.
  So we recommend you to use the PR title with conventional commits type prefixes. We use the following prefixes for the PR title:
    - feat: A new feature
    - fix: A bug fix
    - docs: Documentation only changes
    - style: Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code (white-space, formatting, etc)
    - refactor: A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
    - perf: A code change that improves performance
    - test: Adding missing tests or correcting existing tests
    - chore: Changes to the build process or auxiliary tools and libraries such as documentation generation
    - locale: Changes to the translations

  You can found more information about Conventional Commits here: https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/.
