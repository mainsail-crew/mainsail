<!--
  For Work In Progress Pull Requests, please use the Draft PR feature,
  see https://github.blog/2019-02-14-introducing-draft-pull-requests/ for further details.

  For a timely review/response, please avoid force-pushing additional
  commits if your Pull Request already received reviews or comments.

  For a clean commit history, we squash-merge Pull Requests. The Pull Request title then becomes the commit message.
  Therefore, we advise to have the PR title in form of the Conventional Commits specification.
  We use the following prefixes for the PR title:
    - feat: A new feature
    - fix: A bug fix
    - docs: Changes that only affect documentation
    - style: Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code (white-space, formatting, etc)
    - refactor: A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
    - perf: A code change that improves performance
    - test: Adding missing tests or correcting existing tests
    - chore: Changes to the build process or auxiliary tools and libraries such as documentation generation
    - locale: Changes to the translations

  You can find more information about Conventional Commits here: https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/.
