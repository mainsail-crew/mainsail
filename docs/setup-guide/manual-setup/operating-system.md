## Operation System
> ⚠️ **Please don't use an OctoPi image!**  
It can cause unforeseeable events, like rips in the space-time continuum. So be aware!

It is recommended to use a clean Raspberry Pi OS 32-bit Lite image (previously called Raspbian). You can download it [here](https://downloads.raspberrypi.org/raspios_lite_armhf_latest){:target="_blank"}.  
For more information about installing Raspberry Pi OS click [here](https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/installation/installing-images/){:target="_blank"}. Don't forget to enable ssh.

Once you have finished the installation and are connected via ssh, you can continue.

### Requirements
```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade
sudo apt install git dfu-util unzip
```

> ⚠️ **Moonraker requires Python 3.7 or greater,** verify that your distribution's Python 3 packages meet this requirement.

```
python3 --version
```
