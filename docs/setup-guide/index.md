# Setup Guides

## Local installation
Decide which route you want to follow for the installation. There are several ways to install Mainsail on a Raspberry Pi:

- [MainsailOS](mainsail-os.md) <span class="label label-red">recommended</span>  
	A prebuilt image for your Raspberry Pi. Flash it and you are almost ready to go.
- [KIAUH](kiauh.md) - _Klipper Installation And Update Helper_  
	A script toolbox to install and keep Klipper, Moonraker and Mainsail up to date. It contains many additional features and is the way to go for multiprinter setups.
- [Manual Setup](manual-setup/index.md)  
	The rocky road. If you want to know how everything is set up by hand, you will get all the information here.

## Hosted

Setup [remote access](../quicktips/remote-access) without installing/configuring a web server!
