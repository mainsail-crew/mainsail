# Setup Guides

## Local installation
You will need to choose which way you want to install Mainsail on a Raspberry Pi:

- [MainsailOS](mainsail-os.md) <span class="label label-red">recommended</span>  
	A prebuilt image for your Raspberry Pi. Preconfigured and requires the least amount of setup.
- [KIAUH](kiauh.md) - _Klipper Installation And Update Helper_  
	A script toolbox to install and update Klipper, Moonraker and Mainsail. KIAUH contains additional features and is recommended for multi-printer setups.
- [Manual Setup](manual-setup/index.md)  
	The rocky road for the daring.  For those who want to know how everything is set up manually.

## Hosted

You an also setup [remote access](/quicktips/remote-access) without installing or configuring a web server.

You can test and review a hosted version of Mainsail at [my.mainsail.xyz](http://my.mainsail.xyz). Please read the [documentation](/setup/mainsail-hosted) for usage and configuration.
