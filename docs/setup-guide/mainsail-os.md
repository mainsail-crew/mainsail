# Installing MainsailOS

MainsailOS builds upon Raspberry Pi OS Lite by including Klipper, Moonraker, and Mainsail into the disc image, making setup quick and Mainsail easier to use with Klipper and Moonraker. 

Advanced users may want more complex and custom configurations and Mainsail can be  [manually installed](manual-setup/index.md).

If you are familiar with process to flash the firmware, then please use your preferred method as you normally would. 

If however you are unfamiliar with the flashing process we have documented two methods to flash MainsailOS to your SD card:

* [Raspberry Pi Imager](mainsailos/pi-imager) (cross-platform, easiest) <span class="label label-red">recommended</span>  
* [Balena Etcher](mainsailos/balena-etcher) (requires manual setup)
