# Installing MainsailOS

MainsailOS builds upon RaspberryOS-Lite by incorporating Klipper, Moonraker and Mainsail into one disc image, making them more accessible and quicker to setup than before. 

Complex/custom configurations may be better suited to a [manual](manual-setup/index.md) installation of Mainsail.

If you are familiar with the flashing process, then please use your preferred method as you normally would. 

If however you are unfamiliar with the flashing process then we have documented two methods to flash MainsailOS to your SD card:

* [Raspberry Pi Imager](mainsailos/pi-imager) (cross-platform, easiest) <span class="label label-red">recommended</span>  
* [Balena Etcher](mainsailos/balena-etcher) (requires manual setup)
