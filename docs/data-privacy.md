# Data Privacy

We understand the need for data privacy and have designed Mainsail to operate in your browser’s cache locally.

The following table applies to Mainsail when installed locallaly, or accessed via [my.mainsail.xyz](http://my.mainsail.xyz).

| YES | NO |
| :--------------: | :---------------: |
| Store static files in browser storage (.html, .js, .css) | ‘Phone home’ | 
| Communicate directly with your printer via the Moonraker API | Send/transfer any data externally |

## Will my data be safe if I use the hosted version?
Accessing [my.mainsail.xyz](http://my.mainsail.xyz) stores the .html, .js and .css files for Mainsail locally in the brower's storage in exactly the same way that an instance running on your local hardware would do. In reality, there is no functional difference (or concern) between accessing Mainsail from a privately or publicly hosted instance. 

 
Parallel operation is also possible.
