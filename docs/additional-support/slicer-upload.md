## Upload from Slicer
### PrusaSlicer/SuperSlicer (prior to v2.3.0)

You can upload your GCode-files from your Slicer. Moonraker simulates the octoprint-upload function.

If not already been done, switch to advanced or expert mode and set the options under "Printer Settings / General" as shown in the screenshot below.
For "API Key" you can type anything.
